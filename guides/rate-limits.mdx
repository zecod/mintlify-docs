description: Understand API rate limits and concurrency

Rate limits prevent abuse and ensure fair usage for all users.

## Concurrency limits

Maximum concurrent requests per plan:

| Plan | Regular TTS | Streaming TTS |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| Pro | 18 | 10 |
| Business | 25 | 15 |

Requests beyond these limits will queue or be rejected.

## Request limits

- **Max text length:** 5,000 characters per request
- **Timeout:** 120 seconds (regular), 180 seconds (streaming)

## How it works

When you hit the concurrency limit:

1. New requests queue automatically
2. Requests process as slots become available
3. Queued requests timeout after 30 seconds

## Handling rate limits

### Check your concurrent requests

Track active requests in your application:

```javascript
let activeRequests = 0;
const MAX_CONCURRENT = 18; // Pro plan

async function throttledRequest(text, voice, model) {
  while (activeRequests >= MAX_CONCURRENT) {
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
  }

  activeRequests++;
  try {
    return await makeRequest(text, voice, model);
  } finally {
    activeRequests--;
  }
}
```

### Use a queue

For many requests, use a proper queue:

```javascript
import PQueue from 'p-queue';

const queue = new PQueue({ concurrency: 18 });

// Add requests to queue
const results = await Promise.all([
  queue.add(() => makeRequest(text1, voice, model)),
  queue.add(() => makeRequest(text2, voice, model)),
  queue.add(() => makeRequest(text3, voice, model))
]);
```

### Split large texts

Keep requests under 5,000 characters:

```javascript
function splitText(text, maxLength = 5000) {
  const sentences = text.match(/[^.!?]+[.!?]+/g) || [text];
  const chunks = [];
  let current = '';

  for (const sentence of sentences) {
    if ((current + sentence).length > maxLength) {
      chunks.push(current.trim());
      current = sentence;
    } else {
      current += sentence;
    }
  }

  if (current) chunks.push(current.trim());
  return chunks;
}
```

## Monitor usage

Check your balance regularly:

```bash
curl https://api.neospeech.io/v1/balance \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```
