## Voice Testing

### Listen to Samples

Always listen to voice samples before production:

```javascript
const voices = await listVoices();

voices.voices.forEach(voice => {
  console.log(`${voice.name}: ${voice.sample_url}`);
});
```

### A/B Test Voices

Test multiple voices with your audience:

```javascript
const voicesToTest = ['lyra', 'zara', 'marcus'];

for (const voice of voicesToTest) {
  const audio = await generateSpeech({
    input: 'Your test message here',
    voice: voice,
    model: 'aurora-3.5'
  });

  // Present to test users and collect feedback
  await presentToTestUsers(voice, audio);
}
```

### Test with Your Content

Generate samples using your actual content:

```javascript
const sampleText = `
  Welcome to our platform.
  This is a sample of how our content will sound.
  Please evaluate the voice quality and tone.
`;

const audio = await generateSpeech({
  input: sampleText,
  voice: 'lyra',
  model: 'aurora-3.5'
});
```

## Voice Customization

### Pitch Adjustment

Adjust voice pitch to match your brand:

```javascript
// Higher pitch (more energetic)
const audio1 = await generateSpeech({
  voice: 'lyra',
  pitch: '+15%',
  input: 'Welcome to our service!'
});

// Lower pitch (more authoritative)
const audio2 = await generateSpeech({
  voice: 'marcus',
  pitch: '-10%',
  input: 'This is an important announcement.'
});
```

### Style Control

Apply emotional styles to voices:

```javascript
// Excited style for promotional content
const excited = await generateSpeech({
  voice: 'kai',
  style: 'excited',
  styleDegree: '1.8',
  input: 'Check out our amazing new features!'
});

// Calm style for meditation content
const calm = await generateSpeech({
  voice: 'zara',
  style: 'calm',
  styleDegree: '1.2',
