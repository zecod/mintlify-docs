## Quality vs Speed Trade-offs

### Audio Quality Spectrum

```
Highest Quality ←─────────────────────→ Fastest Speed

Aurora 4    Aurora 3.5    Aurora 3    Turbo 3    Mini 2
  ↑            ↑            ↑           ↑          ↑
Premium       High       Standard     Fast      Lightweight
192kbps      96kbps      160kbps    64kbps     48kbps
```

### File Size Comparison

For 1 minute (60 seconds) of audio:

| Model | File Size | Quality |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Aurora 4 | ~1.4 MB | Premium |
| Aurora 3.5 | ~720 KB | High |
| Aurora 3 | ~1.2 MB | Standard |
| Turbo 3 | ~480 KB | Good |
| Mini 2 | ~360 KB | Basic |

## Model Selection Helper

Use the models endpoint to inspect specs programmatically.

### Filter by Quality Tier

```bash
curl -s "https://api.neospeech.io/v1/models/list" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEOSPEECH_API_KEY" \
  | jq -r '.data.models[] | select(.quality == "premium") | "\(.id) — \(.description)"'
```

### Spot Low-Bandwidth Options

```bash
curl -s "https://api.neospeech.io/v1/models/list" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEOSPEECH_API_KEY" \
  | jq -r '.data.models[] | select(.bitrate == "48kbps" or .bitrate == "64kbps") | "\(.id): \(.bitrate)"'
```

### Compare Sample Rates

```bash
curl -s "https://api.neospeech.io/v1/models/list" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEOSPEECH_API_KEY" \
  | jq -r '.data.models[] | "\(.id)\t\(.sample_rate)"'
```

## Performance Considerations

### Response Speed

- **Aurora 4 & Aurora 3.5:** Prioritize fidelity and may take a touch longer to render.
- **Aurora 3:** Balances speed and quality for everyday production workloads.
- **Turbo 3:** Tuned for rapid turnarounds in live or interactive experiences.
- **Mini 2:** Keeps responses quick while minimizing bandwidth usage.

### Bandwidth Requirements

Streaming bandwidth needed:

- **Aurora 4:** ~192 kbps
- **Aurora 3.5:** ~96 kbps
- **Aurora 3:** ~160 kbps
- **Turbo 3:** ~64 kbps
- **Mini 2:** ~48 kbps (lowest)

### Cost Efficiency

All models cost the same per character, so choose based on quality and speed needs, not cost per request.
