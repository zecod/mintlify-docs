Choose the right model based on quality needs and speed requirements. Each model balances audio fidelity against processing time.

## Request

```bash
curl "https://api.neospeech.io/v1/models/list" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-your-api-key"
```

## Parameters

<ParamField header="Authorization" type="string" required>
  Bearer token: `Bearer sk-your-api-key`
</ParamField>

## Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "models": [
      {
        "id": "aurora-4",
        "name": "Aurora 4",
        "description": "Premium quality model",
        "sample_rate": "48kHz",
        "bitrate": "192kbps",
        "quality": "premium"
      }
    ],
    "total": 5
  }
}
```

## Available models

| Model | Quality | Sample Rate | Best For |
|-------|---------|-------------|----------|
| **aurora-4** | Premium | 48kHz, 192kbps | Broadcasting, professional media |
| **aurora-3.5** | High | 48kHz, 96kbps | Podcasts, audiobooks, e-learning |
| **aurora-3** | Standard | 24kHz, 160kbps | General content creation |
| **turbo-3** | Good | 16kHz, 64kbps | Chatbots, real-time apps |
| **mini-2** | Basic | 24kHz, 48kbps | IoT devices, mobile apps |

## When to use each

### Aurora 4

Use for content where quality matters most:
- Professional video production
- Radio and TV broadcasting
- High-end marketing content
- Premium entertainment

Higher file sizes and longer processing time are worth it when audio quality is critical.

### Aurora 3.5

The sweet spot for most applications:
- Podcasts and audiobooks
- Online courses and training
- Business presentations
- Professional voiceovers

Excellent quality with reasonable file sizes and processing time. Start here unless you have specific needs.

### Turbo 3

When speed matters more than quality:
- Conversational AI and chatbots
- Voice assistants
- Interactive voice response (IVR)
- Real-time gaming

Lower audio quality is acceptable when users need immediate responses.

### Mini 2

For resource-constrained environments:
- IoT and embedded devices
- Mobile apps with limited bandwidth
- Development and prototyping
- High-volume batch processing

Smallest files and lowest resource usage, but noticeably lower quality.

## Common patterns

### Get all models

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.neospeech.io/v1/models/list', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` }
});

const { data } = await response.json();
console.log(`${data.total} models available`);
```

### Choose by use case

```javascript
function selectModel(useCase) {
  const modelMap = {
    'broadcasting': 'aurora-4',
    'podcast': 'aurora-3.5',
    'audiobook': 'aurora-3.5',
    'chatbot': 'turbo-3',
    'mobile': 'mini-2'
  };

  return modelMap[useCase] || 'aurora-3.5';
}

const model = selectModel('podcast');
```

### Pick by quality priority

```javascript
function selectByPriority(priority) {
  if (priority === 'quality') return 'aurora-4';
  if (priority === 'speed') return 'turbo-3';
  if (priority === 'size') return 'mini-2';
  return 'aurora-3.5'; // balanced
}
```

## Making the choice

Start with **aurora-3.5** for most projects. It offers excellent quality at reasonable speed.

Upgrade to **aurora-4** only if you're producing professional media where audio fidelity is critical. The quality difference is subtle but matters for high-end applications.

Switch to **turbo-3** for conversational experiences where users expect instant responses.

Use **mini-2** only when bandwidth or storage is severely limited. The quality drop is significant compared to other models.

Test your actual content with different models. What sounds good in demos might not work for your specific use case.
